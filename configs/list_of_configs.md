Created on: July 23rd
Code file: code/main.py
Purpose: To generate VADPF values for 5 communities of data (testing pipeline)
Additional notes: At this point, we didn't need to specify the specific communities of interest. Also, didn't apply any functions to current_data directly, so sentence_id tags are missing.
